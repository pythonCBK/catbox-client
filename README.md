‚ö†Ô∏è**Attention**

Project is under development and has bugs that need to be fixed! I'm trying to fix them all as early as possible! Thank you for understanding!

üìñ**Information**

Catbox Client is a free open-source client version of a popular website Catbox and Litterbox. Easily upload your files and manage them in the app. By using official Catbox and Litterbox APIs app provides the same functions as the website. Anonymous and authorized file upload in Catbox, choosing the file storage time in Litterbox and deleting files from Catbox is also available!
<br><br>
~App is also available on mobile devices!~ No. Unfortunately there are some problems with porting app for mobile devices right now. I will fix it in the future.

üßæ**How to?**

Project is written in Python so at first its interpreter is required. Before using it you also need to install some required libraries:

```python
pip install kivy requests https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD/archive/master.zip
```
Code is messy rn so sorry if you try to read it, I will make it better in the future.
